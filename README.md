# 100-Followers

Late at night on 2nd June 2022, we hit 100 followers on Github! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

I would like to say a big thank you to each and every single one of you for helping me through this journey. Whether you have followed me, starred my repositories or even just taken the time to view my Github profile, I would like to take this moment to let you know that all of your actions h(ave helped. Without all of you, it wouldn't have been possible to go from ground zero to 100 followers and nearly 200 repositories over the course of just 176 days. As an emerging developer, it would really help you you could continue to show your support by following me on my [main account](https://github.com/CodeMaster7000) as well as my [alternative account](https://github.com/CodeMaster7000Alt). I am fully aware that I haven't been posting much on my alternative account, but I promise that once I start development of some major projects, that account will spring back into life.

To conclude, I would like to give a special thank you to [SmashedFrenzy16](https://github.com/SmashedFrenzy16) for helping me along this journey. As mentioned previously in the '100 Repos' message, without him, none of this would have been possible. So to conclude, thank you everyone for your support in helping me reach 100 followers, and I hope we can reach 200 or even 500 in the near future!
